# Way of Chess
CS Class 12th Project 2024-25

## Project Description:
A simplified [﻿chess.com](https://chess.com/) copy :)

Can be accessed @ [﻿github.com/TheCoderBroSr/WayOfChess](https://github.com/TheCoderBroSr/WayOfChess) 

## Gameplay:
- **Local 1v1 (White & Black):**
    - Profile creation (skip if already done).
    - Log in to profiles.
- **Different Game Modes:**
    - Normal (w/ different time controls)
    - *Checkmate Roulette (checkmate with a random piece)
    - *Piece odds (one player starts with a piece less. E.g. knight odds, bishop odds, rook odds, etc.)
- **Match Analysis:**
    - *A different tab where a particular game can be analyzed using a chess engine like Stockfish 16.
      
'*' -> Future implementation

## Other Future Implementations:
- vs Bots
- Learning Area (opening prep. / study game positions etc)
- Puzzle Solving
- Leaderboard (Various COD-inspired titles like diamond, platinum etc) (eg. +5/±2/-3 -> W/D/L)


## Possible Project Implementations:
- **The game itself**:
    1. Web-based approach - using HTML & CSS for the game frontend and chessboard, and Python Flask for the backend.
    2. Local Application - using Python Pygame.
- **Data Management:**
    1. MySQL DB - Store small details like player name, match result, etc.
    2. File Handling - Store large details like moves played in localized files.
    3. Data Retrieval - During log-in, *match analysis or *Leaderboard.
    4. Data Insertion - During sign-in, after match etc.
